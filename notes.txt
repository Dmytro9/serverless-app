Serverless - not without servers, it's about focusing on delivering functionality and not on scaling the servers. 
Most of the services used with this architecture are auto-scalable.

VCode Extension - Serverless IDE 

Comunication in Microservices: 
 - Pub/Sub
 - Events streams
 - Message queues (Kafka, RabitMQ ...)


1. Install AWS cli  (search install aws cli)
2. Install Serverless framework (https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) (check instalation  sls --version)
3. Create new User IAM - in AWS, log in with this user
4. Configure aws on your mashine running - `aws configure` with created IAM user 


### Commands
To create a project: https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/create
Used template: https://github.com/arielweinberger/sls-base

### Deploy: 
`serverless deploy`
go to CloudFormation service to check
` serverless deploy -f <fn_name>` - function deploy if we have change only function

Remove app - `serverless remove`

Function - createAuction(event, context): event (includes all request data (body, path, query, headers...)); context (lambda function metadata)

## Adding DynamoDB (in .yaml) (infrastructure as code by specifying fields)

## CloudWatch -> Logs -> Log groups - to see logs (success OR errors - aws logger sevice)

## Add permissions to write to DynamoDB (in .yaml)

  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action: 
        - dynamodb:PutItem
      Resource: 
        - arn:aws:dynamodb:#{AWS::Region}:#{AWS::AccountId}:table/AuctionsTable


then check in IAM-> roles -> auction-service-dev-eu-west-1-lambdaRole (your service role)

- #{AWS::Region} - vars which are possibile to use adding due to: serverless-pseudo-parameters plugin (in .yaml)


## processAuctions (cron or rate handler) which runs every 1 minute
Amazon EventBridge (AWS) -> Rules - to check the specified roles (cron/rate) with target or watcher of specific types of events 

`serverless logs -f processAuctions` - to check the logs of handler 
`serverless logs -f processAuctions --startTime 1m` - to check the logs starting from ... (1h ...)  
`serverless invoke -f processAuctions -l` - to run the handler manually
