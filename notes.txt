Serverless - not without servers, it's about focusing on delivering functionality and not on scaling the servers. 
Most of the services used with this architecture are auto-scalable.


Comunication in Microservices: 
 - Pub/Sub
 - Events streams
 - Message queues (Kafka, RabitMQ ...)


1. Install AWS cli  (search install aws cli)
2. Install Serverless framework (https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) (check instalation  sls --version)
3. Create new User IAM - in AWS, log in with this user
4. Configure aws on your mashine running - `aws configure` with created IAM user
